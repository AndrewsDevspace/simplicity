Another would-be city-builder clone... XD

Is it possible using only/mostly Web technologies?
Could it be better than the usual fare of mobile games that style themselves as city builders?
How far can I go with my limited free time and still very incomplete knowledge of, well, everything game development?
Could be fun to find out!
