# Simplicity
Another would-be city-builder clone... XD\
Will it be possible using only Web technologies?\
Could be fun to find out!

## About current version: 0.0.1.
The UI is working.\
Has a nice nested menu system for building the city and viewing its statistics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Firefox is **not supported** currently. It can't deal properly with **vertically wrapping flexboxes**, making width sizing problems on the page.

Uses (will use) the Local Storage for game saves,\
with up to 5 save slots, 1MB/slot.

> [!WARNING]
> NOT FOR MOBILE: must have a minimum display resolution of **1600Ã—900** to "play"!\
> Please use an up-to-date **Desktop browser**, with JavaScript and local site data saving (Cookies, etc.) enabled.\
> Low resolutions and a disabled JavaScript setting will trigger error screens.\
> A "no local data saving allowed" policy will disable the project's save function (and its Save buttons).
