Will it be possible using only Web technologies?\
Could be fun to find out!

## About current version: 0.0.1.
The UI is working. Has a nice menu system.\
(Except for Firefox, which can't deal with vertically wrapping flexboxes properly.)

Uses (will use) the Local Storage for game saves, with up to 5 save slots, 1MB/slot.

## Used tech.
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- JQuery.
