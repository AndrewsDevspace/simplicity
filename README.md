# Simplicity
Another would-be city-builder clone... XD\
Will it be possible using only Web technologies?\
Could be fun to find out!

## About current version: 0.0.1.
The UI is working. Has a nice menu system.\
(Except for Firefox, which can't deal with vertically wrapping flexboxes properly.)

Uses (will use) the Local Storage for game saves, with up to 5 save slots, 1MB/slot.

NOT FOR MOBILE: must have a minimum display resolution of 1600Ã—900 to "play"!\
Please use an up-to-date Desktop browser, with JavaScript and local site data saving (Cookies, etc.) enabled.\
Low resolutions and a disabled JavaScript setting will trigger error screens.\
"No local data saving allowed" will disable the project's Save function (its Save buttons).

## Used tech.
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- JQuery.
